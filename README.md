=========

Port of the Eigenmath math engine to the Casio Prizm (fx-CG 10 and 20)

For compiling, the Makefile assumes you have a special build of mkg3a with support for eActivity strip creation.
If you don't have this special mkg3a, use Makefile.standard instead (eActivity strip will not be available).
