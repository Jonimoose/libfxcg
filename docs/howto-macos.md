# Getting started on macOS

This document will walk you through the process of setting up the Prizm SDK and building your first add-in on macOS. If you don't use macOS, refer to the information in the [top-level README](../README.md).

## Download and install the PrizmSDK Installer

Download the PrizmSDK Installer for AppleSilicon from the [releases
page](https://github.com/Insoft-UK/libfxcg/releases/)

Download the PrizmSDK Binary for Intel from the [releases
page](https://github.com/Insoft-UK/libfxcg/releases/tag/v0.5.2)
Extract and drag & drop into your CASIO folder in Applications

### For installing pre-compiled binary files.
Open a Terminal window and navigate to the example directory.
```
grep -qxF 'export PATH=/Applications/CASIO/PrizmSDK:/Applications/CASIO/PrizmSDK/bin:/Applications/CASIO/PrizmSDK/sh3eb-elf/bin:$PATH' ~/.zshrc || echo 'export PATH=/Applications/CASIO/PrizmSDK:/Applications/CASIO/PrizmSDK/bin:/Applications/CASIO/PrizmSDK/sh3eb-elf/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
grep -qxF 'export FXCGSDK=/Applications/CASIO/PrizmSDK' ~/.zshrc || echo 'export FXCGSDK=/Applications/CASIO/PrizmSDK' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
>[!NOTE]
You may require **gmp, mpfr, libmpc and isl** to be installed, also **imagemagick** is required by the icon script.

`brew install gmp mpfr libmpc isl imagemagick`

## The Example Project

Navigate to `Projects`, then `Example`. This directory contains the example project to get you started with and looks like this:

![Projects directory layout](img/macos/projects-dir.png)
![Example project directory layout](img/macos/example-dir.png)

The `Icon~sel.bmp` and `Icon~uns.bmp` images are built into the compiled add-in and are the icons shown in the calculator's menus for the add-in when it is selected with the cursor and unselected, respectively.

`Makefile` is a plain-text file that includes instructions that tell the system how to compile the add-in. You can edit this with any text editor of your choice, but in most cases don't need to (and probably shouldn't unless you know what you're doing). If you're just getting started, it's safe to ignore this file. Similarly, `make.sh` allows you to run a single command and compile the **add-in** and you shouldn't need to touch it.

In the `src` directory is the add-in source code, which contains one file: `main.c`. All of the C/C++ files in this directory will be compiled into your application so you can add more files to your own project, but just the given file is sufficient to build the example project.

## Compile the example project

To compile the example project, simply run `make.sh` in the project directory using the Terminal.

Open a Terminal window and navigate to the example directory.

![Open Terminal from Applications/Utilities](img/macos/open-terminal.png)

Then type `.\make`, which should run the compilation process and may emit additional messages:

![After running make, we see some mysterious output.](img/macos/make.png)

If successful, this should build a `.bin` and `.g3a` file in the project directory:

![Project directory after successful build](img/macos/result.png)

The `Example.g3a` file is ready to send to your calculator for running now.

## Making changes and rebuilding

Every time you run `make` as above, the system will rebuild the **g3a** file if there have been any changes to the sources. It's possible that won't always work as you expect, so you can also run `.\make clean` to erase the output files from the compilation process and ensure you're building a totally fresh version.

## Making your own project

Now that you know how to build an add-in, it's time to write your own program.
Make a copy of the `Example` project and call it something else (probably a name related to what your project is), then you can write your own code however you like.
